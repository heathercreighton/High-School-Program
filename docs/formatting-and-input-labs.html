<p>Create a program that will give a user a raise on their current salary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a user to input their name as a string and store it to variable <code>name</code> </li>
<li>Ask a user to input their salary <strong>as an int</strong> and store it in variable <code>salary</code> </li>
<li>Create a variable called <code>raise_per</code> that is set to a <strong>random</strong> integer value between 0 and 100. (Hint: Review the random method) </li>
<li>Create a variable called <code>raise_amount</code> that is equal to the inputted <code>salary</code><strong>plus</strong> the added random percentage from the previous step.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Python3 Formatting, print out the person's name and salary in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>Enter your name: Helga
&gt;&gt;&gt; Enter your salary: 15000
Helga, your current salary is $15000.
Your raise is 15% of $15000.
